******************Description and Instructions for FileCapture_v1.0.DLL*************************



Description: Postprocessor for the use with GoldSim® commercial software. The program is intended 
as a DLL for use with a GoldSim® model file. The DLL is called during a GoldSim® model simulation 
to copy input/output files created during the simulation to a central location on a local LAN. 
The software is used as part of a modeling package that consists of GoldSim.exe and other external 
codes linked and executed during a GoldSim model simulation. The FileCapture_v1.0.DLL is used to 
run Monte Carlo analyses with a GoldSim® simulation. Thus any input or output file can be captured, 
when the simulation is run locally or when using the distributed processing (i.e., multi-processor run) 
feature in GoldSim.  Using the input file 'FileCapture.in' to list the filenames 
and path, FileCapture_v1.0.DLL copies the files listed in 'FileCapture.in' from each node on the
LAN to a folder called 'FCAP Files' created in the location give as the path. The DLL will execute 
onece for each realization and append a number to each file copied as an identifier for which realization
the file was generated (e.g. file.dat is copied as file_00001.dat for realization 1).



             *****************Instructions for Use****************************

If you are using the pre-compiled DLL it has been compiled for Windows 2000/XP
operating systems. You must first link the DLL to a GoldSim model file using the 
external DLL function within the GoldSim code. Then EDIT the FileCapture.in file.

LINKING TO GOLDSIM:

Create an External DLL element in GoldSim. Define two input values
passed by GoldSim to the DLL and one output value from the DLL to GoldSim:

Input# 1) Switch (1==on) that is used to execute the file copy command. It is not necessary
to have the FileCapture DLL execute during a local run.

Input# 2) Realization Number. The DLL uses the realization number to tag each file it copies
to the selected location.

Output #1)The output is a scalar value that is passed to GoldSim from the DLL indicating that
DLL has completed.


EDIT FileCapture.in File:

The first line in the FileCapture.in file is used by the DLL to identify where you want to 
copy the files. The second line indicates how many which files are to be copied. And thereafter 
list the files to be copied; one per line. 

The basic format of the FileCapture.in file is as follows:

\\computer name\folder name\        <<***enter the path to where you whan the files copied
3                                  <<***enter the number of files to be copied
input.dat                           <<***list the file names, one per line
output.dat
debug.dat
